# STLS [Smart traffic light System]

This is an Arduino based Smart traffic light System to control and organize the road.

In this project we will be simulating the traffic light system as in real life. 

The Red LED will be switched ON for n seconds followed by yellow and Green. Then Green will get turned OFF and yellow will be switched ON for few seconds followed by RED again and the cycle goes ON.

We include the pedestrian crossing feature, the signal lights should operate to RED LED whenever someone pushes the crossing button as in real life. So instead of lights changing every n seconds, the light will change only when the button is activated.


**Needed Items**
- Arduino UNO
- 10k and 220  ohm resistors
- LEDs
- Push buttons
- Wires
